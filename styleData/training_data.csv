Perhaps you should educate yourself about what suboxone is and what it isnt. It is NOT a drug you take to get high. You cant get high on suboxone. Then once you begin taking suboxone, other opiates have no effect, ZERO effect. They dont do anything- not relieve pain, not get you high, nothing. Suboxone is not addictive its physically needed. Without it youll go through withdrawal. Then, it takes a year or longer for opiates to actually work to only relieve pain. Suboxone is not trading one evil for another. Suboxone saves lives. Narcan or Naloxone, an ingredient in suboxone, is used to reverse overdose. EDUCATE yourself before jumping to conclusions.

My Oliphant collections is at $1,000 (but $600 lump sum)
And my MVB card says the account was closed and says ""Profit and loss write off"" and ""In collections/Charge off"" whatever that means
And then I have my student loan debt but I think that's a given and I'm not going to worry too much about it

Now, let's talk about my income and expenses
Last paycheck (bi weekly): $326
Rent (just got increased): $925
Electric : $60-$100
Gas: $20-$60
Water: ?? It was payed with rent but now it's in our name
Sewage: ?? Again, was with rent, now it's not
Trash: $40
Food: $100 per week

Ariel just got her job working at the bookstore so that's an extra
$9/hr * 20-30/hrW = 180-270 per week, so 
Per paycheck: $360-$540
But that's given she works more than 20 hours which is a stretch for anything on campus 

(She can work more hours cause she's not a full-time student)

That's the whole of it, except pennies and dimes Ariel has been getting $200/2wk for food from her grandmother but I wouldn't rely on that"
